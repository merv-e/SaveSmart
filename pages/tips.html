    <h1>Tip of the day</h1>

    <p>
      Plan your meals: Switching to online grocery shopping means that you can
      carefully compare the prices of the products you add to your basket, make
      the most of offers and not be tempted into buying snacks to eat the minute
      you leave the store! You can also make the most of meal-planning tools
      like <a href="https://www.lollipopai.com/">Lollipop</a> to buy only
      exactly what you need. Explore meal options that are tasty, healthy and
      kind to your savings. Cook in bulk so you can reduce cooking time and food
      waste, and freeze leftovers for later.
